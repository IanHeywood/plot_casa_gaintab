# plot_casa_gaintab

Plot time-dependent gain solutions produced by CASA's gaincal task. This is geared towards VLA calibration but should work for any gain table, although those with only a single SPW might not make economical use of the plot space.

The goal is to provide a global overview of the solutions to indentify misbehaving antennas or SPWs, and gauge solution coherence. This comes at the expense of any axis labels whatsoever.
